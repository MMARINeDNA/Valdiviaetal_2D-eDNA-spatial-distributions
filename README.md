# Spatial_eDNA

The repository comprises of R code that can be used to obtain environmental layers, process metadata from Hake sampling and assess the spatial distribution of eDNA of various marine mammals using GAMs. The processing steps are divided into four parts: 

Step 1: Get data from metadata 

Step 2: Get environmental layers

Step 3: Model all 

Step 4: Model Laob 

These steps can be used to analyse and evaluate different data sets for marine mammal studies.
