# Marine mammal eDNA distribution

The repository contains R code that can be utilized to acquire environmental layers, metadata processing from Hake sampling, and evaluate the spatial distribution of eDNA of different marine mammals using GAMs. The processing steps are divided into four parts.

**Step 1**: Get data from metadata 

**Step 2**: Get environmental layers

**Step 3**: Model all 

**Step 4**: Model Laob 

These steps can be used to analyze and evaluate different data sets for marine mammal studies.
