# A GAM approach for describing species distribution using eDNA-occurrence data

The repository contains R code that can be utilized to acquire environmental layers, metadata processing from Hake sampling, and evaluate the spatial distribution of eDNA of different marine mammals using GAMs. The processing steps are divided into three parts.

**Step 1**: Get data from metadata, mainly data wrangling, to have a formatted data frame.

**Step 2**: Obtain environmental data layers and use them to extract information to sampling sites.

**Step 3**: Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and model selection for the species being modeled. This process involves using statistical techniques to determine the most appropriate model for each species.
